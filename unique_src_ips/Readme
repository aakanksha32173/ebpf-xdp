                                                              ----------------------
This project contains a Python script load.py that loads the C program ippackets.c. The C program tracks unique IP addresses and updates a counter each time a
corresponding IP address reoccurs. Once running in kernel space, the program will print all IPs coming on the interface until a keyboard interrupt(Ctrl C)occurs.
